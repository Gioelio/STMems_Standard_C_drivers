# LSM6DSV

The LSM6DSV is a high-end, low-noise, low-power 6-axis small IMU, featuring a
3-axis digital accelerometer and
a 3-axis digital gyroscope, that offers the best IMU sensor with a
triple-channel architecture for processing
acceleration and angular rate data on three separate channels (user interface,
OIS, and EIS) with dedicated
configuration, processing, and filtering.

The LSM6DSV enables processes in edge computing, leveraging embedded advanced
dedicated features such
as a sensor fusion low-power (SFLP) algorithm and a finite state machine (FSM)
for configurable motion tracking.

The LSM6DSV supports the adaptive self-configuration (ASC) feature, which
allows the FSM to automatically
reconfigure the device in real time based on the detection of a specific motion
pattern, without any intervention from the host processor.
