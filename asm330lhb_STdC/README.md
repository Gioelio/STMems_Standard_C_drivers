# ASM330LHB

The ASM330LHB is a system-in-package featuring a high-performance 3-axis digital accelerometer and 3-axis digital gyroscope.

This device is suitable for telematics and dead-reckoning applications as well as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2X) and impact detection as a result of its high stability over temperature and time, combined with superior sensing precision.

Supporting dual operating modes, the device has enhanced flexibility versus application requirements, leveraging on multiple voltage and multiple ODR selections. The device also includes digital features like a finite state machine and an ST proprietary machine learning core, allowing defined motion pattern detection or some complex algorithms run in the application processor to be moved to the MEMS sensor with the advantage of consistent reduction in power consumption.

The event-detection interrupts enable efficient and reliable motion-activated functions, implementing hardware recognition of free-fall events, 6D orientation, activity or inactivity, and wake-up events.

Like the entire portfolio of MEMS sensor modules, the ASM330LHB leverages the robust and mature in-house manufacturing processes already used for the production of micromachined accelerometers and gyroscopes. The various sensing elements are manufactured using specialized micromachining processes, while the IC interfaces are developed using CMOS technology that allows the design of a dedicated circuit, which is trimmed to better match the characteristics of the sensing element.

The ASM330LHB is available in a small plastic, land grid array (LGA) package of 2.5 x 3.0 x 0.83 mm to address ultracompact solutions.

This device, used in redundancy (as two modules) and in combination with a dedicated software library, has been evaluated as compatible to be adopted in ASIL B automotive applications. This solution is described in detail in application note AN5691.
