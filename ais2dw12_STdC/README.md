# AIS2DW12

The AIS2DW12 is an ultra-low-power three-axis
linear accelerometer which leverages on the
robust and mature manufacturing processes
already used for the production of micromachined
accelerometers and designed to address nonsafety automotive applications.

The AIS2DW12 has four different ultra-low-power
modes, two user-selectable full scales (±2g/±4g)
and is capable of measuring accelerations with
output data rates from 1.6 Hz to 100 Hz.

The AIS2DW12 has an integrated 32-level first-in,
first-out (FIFO) buffer allowing the user to store
data in order to limit intervention by the host
processor.

The embedded self-test capability allows the user
to check the functioning of the sensor in the final
application.

The AIS2DW12 has a dedicated internal engine
to process motion and acceleration detection
including free-fall, motion and no-motion, wakeup,
activity/inactivity and 6D/4D orientation.

The AIS2DW12 is available in a small thin plastic
land grid array package (LGA) and it is
guaranteed to operate over an extended
temperature range from -40 °C to +85 °C.
