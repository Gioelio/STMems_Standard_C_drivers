# LIS2DTW12

The LIS2DTW12 is an ultralow-power high-performance three-axis linear
accelerometer and temperature sensor belonging to the “femto” family, which
leverages on the robust and mature manufacturing processes already used for the
production of micromachined accelerometers.

The device has user-selectable full scales of ±2g/±4g/±8g/±16g and is capable
of measuring accelerations with output data rates from 1.6 Hz to 1600 Hz.
The LIS2DTW12 has an embedded 0.8 °C (typ. accuracy) temperature sensor with
ODRs ranging from 50 to 1.6 Hz and resolution from 8 to 12 bits.

The LIS2DTW12 has an integrated 32-level first-in, first-out (FIFO) buffer
allowing the user to store data in order to limit intervention by the host processor.

The embedded self-test capability allows the user to check the functioning of
the sensor in the final application.
The device has a dedicated internal engine to process motion and acceleration
detection including free-fall,
wakeup, highly configurable single/double-tap recognition, activity/inactivity,
stationary/motion detection, portrait/ landscape detection, and 6D/4D orientation.

The LIS2DTW12 is available in a small thin plastic land grid array package
(LGA) and it is guaranteed to operate
over an extended temperature range from -40 °C to +85 °C.
