# IIS2ICLX

The IIS2ICLX is a high-accuracy (ultralow noise, high stability, and
repeatability) and low-power, two-axis linear accelerometer with digital output.

The IIS2ICLX has a selectable full scale of ±0.5/±1/±2/±3 g and is capable of
providing the measured accelerations to the application over an I²C or SPI
digital interface.

Its high accuracy, stability over temperature, and repeatability make IIS2ICLX
particularly suitable for inclination measurement applications (inclinometers).

The sensing element is manufactured using a dedicated micromachining process
developed by STMicroelectronics to produce inertial sensors and actuators on
silicon wafers.

The IC interface is manufactured using a CMOS process that allows a high level
of integration to design a dedicated circuit, which is trimmed to better match
the characteristics of the sensing element.

The IIS2ICLX has an unmatched set of embedded features (programmable FSM,
machine learning core, sensor
hub, FIFO, event decoding, and interrupts), which are enablers for implementing
smart and complex sensor
nodes that deliver high accuracy and performance at very low power.

The IIS2ICLX is available in a high-performance (low-stress) ceramic cavity
land grid array (CCLGA) package and
can operate within a temperature range of -40 °C to +105 °C.
