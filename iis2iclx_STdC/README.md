# IIS2ICLX

The IIS2ICLX is a high-accuracy (ultralow noise, high stability, and repeatability) and ultralow-power two-axis digital accelerometer specifically recommended for inclination measurements (inclinometers) in Industry 4.0 applications.

All design aspects and the testing and calibration of the IIS2ICLX have been optimized to reach superior accuracy, stability, repeatability, and extremely low noise.

The IIS2ICLX has a selectable full scale of ±0.5/±1/±2/±3 g and is capable of providing the measured accelerations to the application over an I²C or SPI digital interface.

Its unique set of embedded features (programmable FSM, machine learning core, sensor hub, FIFO, event decoding, and interrupts) facilitates the implementation of smart and complex sensor nodes that deliver high accuracy at very low power.

Like the entire portfolio of ST MEMS sensors, the IIS2ICLX leverages the robust and mature in-house manufacturing processes already used for the production of micromachined accelerometers and gyroscopes. The various sensing elements are manufactured using specialized micromachining processes, while the IC interfaces are developed using CMOS technology that allows the design of a dedicated circuit, which is trimmed to better match the characteristics of the sensing element.

The IIS2ICLX is available in a high-performance (low-stress) ceramic cavity land grid array (CCLGA) package and can operate within a temperature range of -40 °C to +105 °C.
