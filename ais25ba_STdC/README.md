The AIS25BA is an ultralow noise, low latency, wide bandwidth, 3-axis digital
accelerometer with a dedicated TDM interface designed to address automotive
nonsafety applications, in particular, wideband active noise control (ANC) and
vibration monitoring.

The AIS25BA has a user-selectable full-scale range of ±3.85/±7.7 g, a
time-division
multiplexing (TDM) interface for the sensor data, and an I²C interface for
device configuration.

The AIS25BA is available in a small thin plastic land grid array package (LGA)
and is
guaranteed to operate over an extended temperature range from -40 °C to +125 °C.
