# LSM6DSO32X

The LSM6DSO32X is a system-in-package featuring a high-performance 3-axis digital accelerometer and 3-axis digital gyroscope.

The LSM6DSO32X delivers best-in-class motion sensing that can detect orientation and gestures in order to empower application developers and consumers with features and capabilities that are more sophisticated than simply orienting their devices to portrait and landscape mode.

The event-detection interrupts enable efficient and reliable motion tracking and contextual awareness, implementing hardware recognition of free-fall events, 6D orientation, click and double-click sensing, activity or inactivity, stationary/motion detection and wakeup events.

The LSM6DSO32X supports main OS requirements, offering real, virtual and batch mode sensors. In addition, the LSM6DSO32X can efficiently run the sensor-related features specified in Android, saving power and enabling faster reaction time. In particular, the LSM6DSO32X has been designed to implement hardware features such as significant motion detection, stationary/motion detection, tilt, pedometer functions, timestamping and to support the data acquisition of an external magnetometer.

The LSM6DSO32X offers hardware flexibility to connect the pins with different mode connections to external sensors to expand functionalities such as adding a sensor hub, etc.

Up to 9 kbytes of FIFO with compression and dynamic allocation of significant data (i.e. external sensors, timestamp, etc.) allows overall power saving of the system.

Like the entire portfolio of MEMS sensor modules, the LSM6DSO32X leverages the robust and mature in-house manufacturing processes already used for the production of micromachined accelerometers and gyroscopes. The various sensing elements are manufactured using specialized micromachining processes, while the IC interfaces are developed using CMOS technology that allows the design of a dedicated circuit which is trimmed to better match the characteristics of the sensing element.

The LSM6DSO32X is available in a small plastic land grid array (LGA) package of 2.5 x 3.0 x 0.83 mm to address ultra-compact solutions.
