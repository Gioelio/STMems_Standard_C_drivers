# LPS22DF

The LPS22DF is an ultracompact, piezoresistive, absolute pressure sensor that
functions as a digital output barometer. The LPS22DF provides lower power
consumption, achieving lower pressure noise than its predecessor.

The device comprises a sensing element and an IC interface that communicates
over an I²C, MIPI I3CSM, or SPI interface from the sensing element to the
application and supports a wide Vdd IO range for the digital interfaces as well. The sensing
element, which detects absolute pressure, consists of a suspended membrane manufactured
using a dedicated process developed by ST.

The LPS22DF is available in a full-mold, holed LGA package (HLGA). It is
guaranteed to operate over a temperature range extending from -40 °C to +85 °C. 
The package is holed to allow external pressure to reach the sensing element.
