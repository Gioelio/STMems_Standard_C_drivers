# AIS328DQ

The AIS328DQ is an ultra-low-power highperformance 3-axis linear accelerometer
with a
digital serial interface SPI standard output. An I²C
compatible interface is also available. The device
features ultra-low-power operational modes that
allow advanced power saving and smart sleep-towakeup functions. The AIS328DQ
has dynamic
user-selectable full scales of ±2g/±4g/±8g and is
capable of measuring accelerations with output
data rates from 0.5 Hz to 1 kHz. The self-test
capability allows the user to check the functioning
of the sensor in the final application. The device
may be configured to generate an interrupt signal
through inertial wakeup events, or by the position
of the device itself. Thresholds and the timing of
interrupt generators are programmable by the end
user on-the-fly. Available in a small quad flat pack
no-lead package (QFPN) with a 4x4 mm footprint,
the AIS328DQ is able to respond to the trend
towards application miniaturization and is
guaranteed to operate over a temperature range
from -40 °C to +105 °C.
