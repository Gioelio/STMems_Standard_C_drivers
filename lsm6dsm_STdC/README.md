# LSM6DSM

The LSM6DSM is a system-in-package featuring a 3D
digital accelerometer and a 3D digital gyroscope
performing at 0.65 mA in high-performance mode and
enabling always-on low-power features for an optimal
motion experience for the consumer.

The LSM6DSM supports main OS requirements,
offering real, virtual and batch sensors with 4 kbyte for
dynamic data batching.
ST’s family of MEMS sensor modules leverages the
robust and mature manufacturing processes already
used for the production of micromachined
accelerometers and gyroscopes.

The various sensing elements are manufactured using
specialized micromachining processes, while the IC
interfaces are developed using CMOS technology that
allows the design of a dedicated circuit which is
trimmed to better match the characteristics of the
sensing element.

The LSM6DSM has a full-scale acceleration range of
±2/±4/±8/±16 g and an angular rate range of
±125/±250/±500/±1000/±2000 dps.

The LSM6DSM fully supports EIS and OIS applications
as the module includes a dedicated configurable signal
processing path for OIS and auxiliary SPI configurable
for both the gyroscope and accelerometer.
High robustness to mechanical shock makes the
LSM6DSM the preferred choice of system designers for
the creation and manufacturing of reliable products.

The LSM6DSM is available in a plastic land grid array
(LGA) package.
