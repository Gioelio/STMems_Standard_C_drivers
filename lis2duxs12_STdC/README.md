# LIS2DUXS12

The LIS2DUXS12 is a smart, digital, 3-axis linear accelerometer whose MEMS and ASIC have been expressly designed to combine the lowest current consumption possible with features such as always-on antialiasing filtering, a finite state machine (FSM) and machine learning core (MLC) with adaptive self-configuration (ASC), and an analog hub / Qvar sensing channel.

The FSM and MLC with ASC deliver outstanding always-on, edge processing capabilities to the LIS2DUXS12, while the analog hub / Qvar sensing channel defines a new degree of system optimization. The LIS2DUXS12 MIPI I3C® slave interface and embedded 128-level FIFO buffer complete a set of features that make this accelerometer a reference in terms of system integration from a standpoint of the bill of materials, processing, or power consumption.

The LIS2DUXS12 has user-selectable full scales of ±2g/±4g/±8g/±16g and is capable of measuring accelerations with output data rates from 1.6 Hz to 800 Hz.

The LIS2DUXS12 has a dedicated internal engine to process motion and acceleration detection including free-fall, wake-up, single/double/triple-tap recognition, activity/inactivity, and 6D/4D orientation.

The LIS2DUXS12 is available in a small thin plastic, land grid array package (LGA) and it is guaranteed to operate over an extended temperature range from -40°C to +85°C.
