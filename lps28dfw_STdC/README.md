# LPS28DFW

The LPS28DFW is an ultra-compact piezoresistive absolute pressure sensor which
functions as a digital output barometer. The device comprises a sensing element
and an IC interface which communicates over the I²C or MIPI I3CSM interface
from the sensing element to the application. The LPS28DFW provides lower power
consumption, achieving lower pressure noise than its predecessor.

The LPS28DFW is available in a ceramic LGA package with a metal lid. It is
guaranteed to operate over a temperature range extending from -40 °C to +85 °C.
The package is holed to allow external pressure to reach the sensing element.
Gel inside the IC protects the electrical components from water and the metal cap
is, optionally, connected to ground or left floating electrically in the
application PCB layout. The connection of the metal cap is determined according to the
customer’s target application.

This device has been designed to meet the requirements and mission profile for
personal electronics and consumer applications
