# ISM303DAC

The ISM303DAC is a high-performance, lowpower system-in-package featuring a 3D
digital
linear acceleration sensor and a 3D digital
magnetic sensor.

The ISM303DAC has user-selectable linear
acceleration full scales of ±2g/±4g/±8g/±16 g and
is capable of measuring accelerations with output
data rates from 1 Hz to 6400 Hz. The device has
a magnetic field dynamic range of up to
±50 gauss with output data rates from10 Hz to
150 Hz. The ISM303DAC includes an I2C serial
bus interface that supports standard, fast mode,
fast mode plus, and high-speed (100 kHz,
400 kHz, 1 MHz, and 3.4 MHz) and an SPI serial
standard interface.

The ISM303DAC has an integrated 256-level firstin, first-out (FIFO) buffer for
the accelerometer
data which can be used to limit the intervention of
the host processor.

The embedded self-test capability allows the user
to check the functioning of the sensor in the final
application.

The system can be configured to generate an
interrupt signal for free-fall, motion detection and
magnetic field detection. The magnetic and
accelerometer blocks can be enabled or put into
power-down mode separately.

The ISM303DAC is available in a plastic land grid
array package (LGA) and is guaranteed to
operate over an extended temperature range
from -40 °C to +85 °C.
