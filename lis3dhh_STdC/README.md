# LIS3DHH

The LIS3DHH is an ultra-high-resolution and lownoise three-axis linear
accelerometer.

The LIS3DHH has a full scale of 2.5 g and is
capable of providing the measured accelerations
to the application through an SPI 4-wire digital
interface.

The sensing element is manufactured using a
dedicated micromachining process developed by
STMicroelectronics to produce inertial sensors
and actuators on silicon wafers.

The IC interface is manufactured using a CMOS
process that allows a high level of integration to
design a dedicated circuit which is trimmed to
better match the characteristics of the sensing
element.

The LIS3DHH is available in a high-performance
(low-stress) ceramic cavity land grid array (CC
LGA) package and can operate within a
temperature range of -40 °C to +85 °C.
