# LPS22HB

The LPS22HB is an ultra-compact piezoresistive
absolute pressure sensor which functions as a
digital output barometer. The device comprises a
sensing element and an IC interface which
communicates through I2C or SPI from the
sensing element to the application.

The sensing element, which detects absolute
pressure, consists of a suspended membrane
manufactured using a dedicated process
developed by ST.

The LPS22HB is available in a full-mold, holed
LGA package (HLGA). It is guaranteed to operate
over a temperature range extending from -40 °C
to +85 °C. The package is holed to allow external
pressure to reach the sensing element
