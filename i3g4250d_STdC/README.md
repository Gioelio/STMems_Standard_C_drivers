# I3G4250D

The I3G4250D is a low-power 3-axis angular rate
sensor able to provide unprecedented stability at
zero-rate level and sensitivity over temperature
and time. It includes a sensing element and an IC
interface capable of providing the measured
angular rate to the application through a standard
SPI digital interface. An I2C compatible interface
is also available.

The sensing element is manufactured using a
dedicated micromachining process developed by
STMicroelectronics to produce inertial sensors
and actuators on silicon wafers.
The IC interface is manufactured using a CMOS
process that allows a high level of integration to
design a dedicated circuit which is trimmed to
better match the characteristics of the sensing
element.

The I3G4250D has a selectable full scale
(±245/±500/±2000 dps) and is capable of
measuring rates with a user-selectable
bandwidth.

The I3G4250D is available in a plastic land grid
array (LGA) package and can operate within a
temperature range of -40 °C to +85 °C.
