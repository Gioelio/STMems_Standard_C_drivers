# LIS3DH

The LIS3DH is an ultra-low-power highperformance three-axis linear
accelerometer belonging to the “nano” family, with digital I2C/SPI
serial interface standard output. The device
features ultra-low-power operational modes that
allow advanced power saving and smart embedded functions.

The LIS3DH has dynamically user-selectable full
scales of 2g/±4g/8g/16g and is capable of
measuring accelerations with output data rates
from 1 Hz to 5.3 kHz. The self-test capability
allows the user to check the functioning of the
sensor in the final application. The device may be
configured to generate interrupt signals using two
independent inertial wake-up/free-fall events as
well as by the position of the device itself.

Thresholds and timing of interrupt generators are
programmable by the end user on the fly. The
LIS3DH has an integrated 32-level first-in, firstout (FIFO) buffer allowing the
user to store data in order to limit intervention by the host processor.

The LIS3DH is available in small thin plastic land
grid array package (LGA) and is guaranteed to
operate over an extended temperature range
from -40 °C to +85 °C.
