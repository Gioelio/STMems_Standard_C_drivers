# LPS33W

The LPS33W is an ultra-compact piezoresistive pressure sensor which functions
as a digital output barometer. The device comprises a sensing element and an IC
interface which communicates through I²C from the sensing element to the
application.

The sensing element, which detects absolute pressure, consists of a suspended
membrane manufactured using a dedicated process developed by ST.

The LPS33W is available in a ceramic LGA package with metal lid. It is
guaranteed to operate over a temperature range extending from -40 °C to +85 °C.
The package is holed to allow external pressure to reach the sensing element.
Gel inside the IC protects the electrical components from harsh environmental
conditions
