# LIS2DU12

The LIS2DU12 is a linear 3-axis accelerometer with advanced digital functions
whose MEMS and ASIC have been expressly designed to build an outstanding
ultralow-power architecture in which the anti-aliasing filter operates with a
current consumption among the lowest in the market.

The LIS2DU12 has user-selectable full scales of ±2g/±4g/±8g/±16g and is capable
of measuring accelerations with output data rates from 1.6 Hz to 800 Hz.

The LIS2DU12 has an integrated 128-level FIFO buffer allowing to store a wide
range of data, reducing system power consumption.
The embedded self-test capability allows the user to check that the sensor
works in the final application.

The LIS2DU12 has a dedicated internal engine to process motion and acceleration
detection including free-fall, wake-up, single/double-tap recognition,
activity/inactivity, and 6D/4D orientation.

The LIS2DU12 is available in a small 2.0 x 2.0 mm plastic land grid array
package (LGA) only 0.74 mm thin,
which places it among the smallest solution available in the market. It is
guaranteed to operate over an extended temperature range from -40°C to + 85 °C.
