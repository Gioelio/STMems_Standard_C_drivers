# LSM6DSO16IS

The LSM6DSO16IS is a system-in-package featuring a 3-axis digital accelerometer
and a 3-axis digital gyroscope, boosting performance at 0.59 mA in
high-performance
mode and enabling always-on low-power features for optimal motion results in
personal electronics and IoT solutions.

The LSM6DSO16IS has a full-scale acceleration range of ±2/±4/±8/±16 g and
an angular rate range of ±125/±250/±500/±1000/±2000 dps. The module features
programmable interrupts and an on-chip sensor hub which includes up to 6
sensors: the internal accelerometer & gyroscope and 4 external sensors.

The LSM6DSO16IS embeds a new ST category of processing, ISPU (intelligent
sensor processing unit) to support real-time applications that rely on sensor
data. The
ISPU is an ultra-low-power, high-performance programmable core which can
execute signal processing and AI algorithms in the edge. The main benefits of the ISPU
are C programming and an enhanced ecosystem with libraries and 3rd party tools/IDE.

Its optimized ultra-low-power hardware circuitry for real-time execution of the
algorithms is a state-of-the-art feature for any personal electronics, from
wearable accessories to high-end applications.

The LSM6DSO16IS is available in a plastic land grid array (LGA) package.
