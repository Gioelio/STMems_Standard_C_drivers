# L3GD20

The L3GD20 is a low-power three-axis angular
rate sensor.

It includes a sensing element and an IC interface
capable of providing the measured angular rate to
the external world through a digital interface
(I2C/SPI).

The sensing element is manufactured using a
dedicated micro-machining process developed by
STMicroelectronics to produce inertial sensors
and actuators on silicon wafers.

The IC interface is manufactured using a CMOS
process that allows a high level of integration to
design a dedicated circuit which is trimmed to
better match the sensing element characteristics.

The L3GD20 has a full scale of ±250/±500/ ±2000
dps and is capable of measuring rates with a
user-selectable bandwidth.

The L3GD20 is available in a plastic land grid
array (LGA) package and can operate within a
temperature range of -40 °C to +85 °C.
