# LIS3DE

The LIS3DE is an ultra-low-power highperformance 3-axis linear accelerometer
belonging to the “nano” family, with digital I2C/SPI
serial interface standard output. The device
features ultra-low-power operational modes that
allow advanced power saving and smart
embedded functions.

The LIS3DE has dynamically user-selectable full
scales of 2g/4g/8g/16g and is capable of
measuring accelerations with output data rates
from 1 Hz to 5 kHz. The self-test capability allows
the user to check the functioning of the sensor in
the final application. The device may be
configured to generate interrupt signals by two
independent inertial wakeup/free-fall events as
well as by the position of the device itself.

Thresholds and the timing of interrupt generators
are programmable by the end user on the fly. The
LIS3DE has an integrated 32-level first-in, first-out
(FIFO) buffer allowing the user to store data in
order to limit intervention by the host processor.

The LIS3DE is available in a small thin plastic
land grid array package (LGA) and it is
guaranteed to operate over an extended
temperature range from -40 °C to +85 °C.
