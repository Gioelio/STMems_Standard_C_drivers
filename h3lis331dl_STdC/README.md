The H3LIS331DL is a high-g, low-power, high-performance 3-axis linear
accelerometer with digital I²C/SPI serial interface standard output.
The device features ultralow-power operational modes that allow advanced power
saving and smart sleep-to-wake-up functions.

The H3LIS331DL has dynamically user-selectable full scales of ±100g/±200g/±400g
and it is capable of measuring accelerations with output data rates from 0.5 Hz
to 1 kHz.

The H3LIS331DL is available in a small thin plastic land grid array package
(LGA)
and it is guaranteed to operate over an extended temperature range from -40 °C
to +85 °C.
