# LSM6DS3

The LSM6DS3 is a system-in-package featuring a
3D digital accelerometer and a 3D digital gyroscope
performing at 0.90 mA in high-performance mode and
enabling always-on low-power features for an optimal
motion experience for the consumer.

The LSM6DS3 supports main OS requirements,
offering real, virtual and batch sensors with 4 kbyte for
dynamic data batching.
ST’s family of MEMS sensor modules leverages the
robust and mature manufacturing processes already
used for the production of micromachined
accelerometers and gyroscopes.

The various sensing elements are manufactured using
specialized micromachining processes, while the IC
interfaces are developed using CMOS technology that
allows the design of a dedicated circuit which is
trimmed to better match the characteristics of the
sensing element.

The LSM6DS3 has a full-scale acceleration range
of ±2/±4/±8/±16 g and an angular rate range of
±125/±250/±500/±1000/±2000 dps.
High robustness to mechanical shock makes the
LSM6DS3 the preferred choice of system
designers for the creation and manufacturing of reliable
products.

The LSM6DS3 is available in a plastic land grid
array (LGA) package.
