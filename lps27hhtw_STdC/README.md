# LPS27HHTW

The LPS27HHTW is an ultra-compact piezoresistive absolute pressure sensor which
functions as a digital output barometer. The device also embeds a temperature
sensor to monitor ambient temperature. The LPS27HHTW comprises a sensing
element and an IC interface which communicates through I²C, MIPI I3CSM or SPI
from the sensing element to the application.

The sensing element, which detects absolute pressure, consists of a suspended
membrane manufactured using a dedicated process developed by ST.

The LPS27HHTW is available in a ceramic LGA package with metal lid. It is
guaranteed to operate over a temperature range extending from -40 °C to +85 °C.
The package is holed to allow external pressure to reach the sensing element.
Gel inside the IC protects the electrical components from water and the metal cap
is grounded electrically for better ESD robustness
