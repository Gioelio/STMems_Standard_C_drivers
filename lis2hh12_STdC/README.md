# LIS2HH12

The LIS2HH12 is an ultra-low-power highperformance three-axis linear
accelerometer belonging to the “pico” family.

The LIS2HH12 has full scales of 2g/4g/8g and
is capable of measuring accelerations with output
data rates from 10 Hz to 800 Hz.

The self-test capability allows the user to check
the functioning of the sensor in the final
application.

The LIS2HH12 has an integrated first-in, first-out
(FIFO) buffer allowing the user to store data in
order to limit intervention by the host processor.

The LIS2HH12 is available in a small thin plastic
land grid array package (LGA) and it is
guaranteed to operate over an extended
temperature range from -40 °C to +85 °C
