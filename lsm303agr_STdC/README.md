# LSM303AGR

The LSM303AGR is an ultralow-power high-performance system-in-package featuring
a 3-axis digital linear acceleration sensor and a
3-axis digital magnetic sensor.

The LSM303AGR has linear acceleration full
scales of ±2g/±4g/±8g/16g and a magnetic field
dynamic range of ±50 gauss.

The LSM303AGR includes an I²C serial bus
interface that supports standard, fast mode, fast
mode plus, and high-speed (100 kHz, 400 kHz,
1 MHz, and 3.4 MHz) and an SPI serial standard
interface.

The system can be configured to generate an
interrupt signal for free-fall, motion detection, and
magnetic field detection.
The magnetic and accelerometer blocks can be
enabled or put into power-down mode separately.

The LSM303AGR is available in a plastic land
grid array package (LGA) and is guaranteed to
operate over an extended temperature range
from -40 °C to +85 °C.
