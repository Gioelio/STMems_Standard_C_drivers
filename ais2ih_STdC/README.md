# AIS2IH

The AIS2IH is an ultra-low-power three-axis linear accelerometer which
leverages on the robust and mature manufacturing processes already used for the
production of micromachined accelerometers and designed to address non-safety automotive
applications.

The AIS2IH has user-selectable full scales of ±2g/±4g/±8g/±16g and is capable
of measuring accelerations with output data rates from 1.6 Hz to 1600 Hz.

The AIS2IH has an integrated 32-level first-in, first-out (FIFO) buffer
allowing the user
to store data in order to limit intervention by the host processor.

The device offers broad flexibility to applications as it can switch from
ultra-low-power
modes to high-resolution, high-performance modes on the fly.
The embedded self-test capability allows the user to check the functioning of
the sensor in the final application.

The AIS2IH has a dedicated internal engine to process motion and acceleration
detection including free-fall, wakeup, highly configurable single/double-tap
recognition, 6D/4D orientation, and activity/inactivity.

The AIS2IH is available in a small thin plastic land grid array package (LGA)
and it is
guaranteed to operate over an extended temperature range from -40 °C to +115 °C.
