# ASM330LHH

The ASM330LHH is a system-in-package featuring a
3D digital accelerometer and a 3D digital gyroscope
with an extended temperature range up to +105 °C and
designed to address automotive non-safety
applications.

ST’s family of MEMS sensor modules leverages the
robust and mature manufacturing processes already
used for the production of micromachined
accelerometers and gyroscopes to serve both the
automotive and consumer market. The ASM330LHH is
AEC-Q100 compliant and industrialized through a
dedicated MEMS production flow to meet automotive
reliability standards. All the parts are fully tested with
respect to temperature to ensure the highest quality
level.

The sensing elements are manufactured using ST’s
proprietary micromachining processes, while the IC
interfaces are developed using CMOS technology that
allows the design of a dedicated circuit which is
trimmed to better match the characteristics of the
sensing element.

The ASM330LHH has a full-scale acceleration range of
±2/±4/±8/±16 g and a wide angular rate range of
±125/±250/±500/±1000/±2000/±4000 dps that enables
its usage in a broad range of automotive applications.
All the design aspects of the ASM330LHH have been
optimized to reach superior output stability, extremely
low noise and full data synchronization to the benefit of
sensor-assisted applications like dead reckoning and
sensor fusion.

The ASM330LHH is available in a 14-lead plastic land
grid array (LGA) package
