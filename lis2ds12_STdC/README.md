# LIS2DS12

The LIS2DS12 is an ultra-low-power, highperformance three-axis linear
accelerometer belonging to the “pico” family which leverages on
the robust and mature manufacturing processes
already used for the production of micromachined
accelerometers.

The LIS2DS12 has user-selectable full scales of
2g/4g/8g/16g and is capable of measuring
accelerations with output data rates from 1 Hz to
6400 Hz.

The LIS2DS12 has an integrated 256-level firstin, first-out (FIFO) buffer
allowing the user to store
data in order to limit intervention by the host
processor.

The embedded self-test capability allows the user
to check the functioning of the sensor in the final
application.

The LIS2DS12 has a dedicated internal engine
architecture in order to process internally motion
and acceleration detection including free-fall,
wakeup, single and double-tap detection, activityinactivity, portrait and
landscape detection, step
counter and step detection along with significant
motion detection.

The LIS2DS12 is available in a small thin plastic
land grid array package (LGA) and it is
guaranteed to operate over an extended
temperature range from -40 °C to +85 °C.
