# ISM330DLC

The ISM330DLC is a system-in-package 6-axis IMU (inertial measurement unit),
featuring a high-performance 3-axis digital accelerometer and 3-axis digital
gyroscope tailored for Industry 4.0 applications.

ST’s family of MEMS sensor modules leverages the robust and mature
manufacturing processes already used for the production of micromachined
accelerometers and gyroscopes.

The various sensing elements are manufactured using specialized micromachining
processes, while the IC interfaces are developed using CMOS technology that
allows
the design of a dedicated circuit, which is trimmed to better match the
characteristics
of the sensing element.

In the ISM330DLC, the sensing element of the accelerometer and of the gyroscope
are implemented on the same
silicon die, thus guaranteeing superior stability and robustness.

The ISM330DLC has a full-scale acceleration range of ±2/±4/±8/±16 g and an
angular rate range of
±125/±250/±500/±1000/±2000 dps.
Delivering high accuracy and stability with ultralow power consumption (0.75 mA
in high-performance, combo
mode) enables, also in the industrial domain, long-lasting battery-operated
applications.

The ISM330DLC includes a dedicated configurable signal processing path with low
latency, low noise, and
dedicated filtering specifically intended for control loop stability. Data from
this dedicated signal path can be
made available through an auxiliary SPI interface, configurable for both the
gyroscope and accelerometer. Highperformance, high-quality, small size and low
power consumption together with high robustness to mechanical
shock makes the ISM330DLC the preferred choice of system designers for the
creation and manufacturing of
versatile and reliable products.

The ISM330DLC is available in a plastic, land grid array (LGA) package.
