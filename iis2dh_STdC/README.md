# IIS2DH

The IIS2DH is an ultra-low-power highperformance three-axis linear
accelerometer with digital I2C/SPI serial interface standard output.

The IIS2DH has user-selectable full scales of
±2g/±4g/±8g/±16g and is capable of measuring
accelerations with output data rates from 1 Hz to
5.3 kHz.

The device may be configured to generate
interrupt signals by two independent inertial
wake-up/free-fall events as well as by the position
of the device itself.

The self-test capability allows the user to check
the functionality of the sensor in the final
application.

The IIS2DH is available in a small thin plastic land
grid array package (LGA) and is guaranteed to
operate over an extended temperature range
from -40 °C to +85 °C.
