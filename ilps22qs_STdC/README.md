# ILPS22QS

The ILPS22QS is an ultra-compact piezoresistive absolute pressure sensor which
functions as a digital output barometer, supporting dual full-scale up to
userselectable 4060 hPa. The device delivers ultra-low pressure noise with very
low power consumption and operates over an extended temperature range from -40 °C
to +105 °C.

The ILPS22QS comprises a sensing element and an IC interface which
communicates over I²C, MIPI I3CSM or SPI interfaces from the sensing element to
the application and supports 1.2 V digital interface as well. The sensing
element, which detects absolute pressure, consists of a suspended membrane manufactured
using a dedicated process developed by ST.

The ILPS22QS embeds an analog hub sensing functionality which is able to
connect an analog input and convert
it to a digital signal for embedded processing. In addition, an embedded Qvar
(electric charge variation detection)
channel can be enabled for sensing in applications such as water leakage
detection, tap, double tap, long press,
and L/R - R/L swipe.

The ILPS22QS is available in a full-mold, holed LGA package (HLGA). The package
is holed to allow external
pressure to reach the sensing element.
