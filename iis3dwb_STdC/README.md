# IIS3DWB

The IIS3DWB is a system-in-package featuring a 3-axis digital vibration sensor
with low noise over an ultrawide and flat frequency range. The wide bandwidth, low
noise, very stable and repeatable sensitivity, together with the capability of
operating over an extended temperature range (up to +105 °C), make the device particularly
suitable for vibration monitoring in industrial applications.

The high performance delivered at low power consumption together with the
digital output and the embedded digital features like the FIFO and the interrupts are
enabling features for battery-operated industrial wireless sensor nodes.

The IIS3DWB has a selectable full-scale acceleration range of ±2/±4/±8/±16 g
and is capable of measuring accelerations with a bandwidth up to 6 kHz with an output
data rate of 26.7 kHz. A 3 KB first-in, first-out (FIFO) buffer is integrated in the
device to avoid any data loss and to limit intervention from the host processor.

The MEMS sensor module family from ST leverages the robust and mature
manufacturing processes already
used for the production of micromachined accelerometers and gyroscopes to serve
automotive, industrial, and
consumer markets. The sensing elements are manufactured using ST’s proprietary
micromachining process, while the embedded IC interfaces are developed using CMOS technology.

The IIS3DWB has a self-test capability, which allows checking the functioning
of the sensor in the final application.
The IIS3DWB is available in a 14-lead plastic land grid array (LGA) package and
is guaranteed to operate over an
extended temperature range from -40 °C to +105 °C.
