# LSM303AH

The LSM303AH is an ultra-low-power high-performance system-in-package featuring
a 3D digital linear acceleration sensor and a 3D digital
magnetic sensor.

The LSM303AH has user-selectable linear
acceleration full scales of ±2g/±4g/±8g/16 g and
is capable of measuring accelerations with output
data rates from 1 Hz to 6400 Hz. The device has
a magnetic field dynamic range of ±50 gauss with
output data rates from10 Hz to 100 Hz. The
LSM303AH includes an I2C serial bus interface
that supports standard, fast mode, fast mode
plus, and high-speed (100 kHz, 400 kHz, 1 MHz,
and 3.4 MHz) and an SPI serial standard
interface.

The LSM303AH has an integrated 256-level firstin, first-out (FIFO) buffer
allowing the user to store
data in order to limit intervention by the host
processor. The FIFO buffer applies only to the
accelerometer.

The embedded self-test capability allows the user
to check the functioning of the sensor in the final
application.

The system can be configured to generate an
interrupt signal for free-fall, motion detection and
magnetic field detection. The magnetic and
accelerometer blocks can be enabled or put into
power-down mode separately.

The LSM303AH is available in a plastic land grid
array package (LGA) and is guaranteed to
operate over an extended temperature range
from -40 °C to +85 °C.
