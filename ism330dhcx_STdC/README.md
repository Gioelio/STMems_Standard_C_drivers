# ISM330DHCX

The ISM330DHCX is a system-in-package featuring a high-accuracy and high-performance 3D digital accelerometer and 3D digital gyroscope tailored for Industry 4.0 applications.

All the design aspects and the testing and calibration of the ISM330DHCX have been optimized to reach superior accuracy, stability, extremely low noise and full data synchronization.

The ISM330DHCX has a 3D accelerometer capable of wide bandwidth, ultra-low noise and a selectable full-scale range of ±2/±4/±8/±16 g. The 3D gyroscope has an angular rate range of ±125/±250/±500/±1000/±2000/±4000 dps and offers superior stability over temperature and time along with ultra-low noise.

The unique set of embedded features (Machine Learning Core, programmable FSM, 9 kbytes smart FIFO, sensor hub, event decoding and interrupts) facilitate the implementation of smart and complex sensor nodes which deliver high performance at very low power.

The ISM330DHCX offers specific support, both for the gyroscope and the accelerometer, to applications requiring closed control loop (like OIS and other stabilization applications). The device, through a dedicated auxiliary SPI interface and a configurable signal processing path, can provide data for the control loop while, at the same time, a second fully independent path can output data for other applications.

Like the entire portfolio of MEMS sensor modules, the ISM330DHCX leverages the robust and mature in-house manufacturing processes already used for the production of micromachined accelerometers and gyroscopes. The various sensing elements are manufactured using specialized micromachining processes, while the IC interfaces are developed using CMOS technology that allows the design of a dedicated circuit which is trimmed to better match the characteristics of the sensing element.

In the ISM330DHCX, the sensing elements of the accelerometer and of the gyroscope are implemented on the same silicon die, thus guaranteeing superior stability and robustness.

The ISM330DHCX is available in a small plastic land grid array (LGA) package of 2.5 x 3.0 x 0.83 mm.
