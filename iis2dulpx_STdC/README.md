# IIS2DULPX

The IIS2DULPX is an intelligent, digital 3-axis linear accelerometer whose MEMS and ASIC have been expressly designed to combine the lowest supply current
possible with features such as always-on antialiasing filtering, a finite state machine (FSM) and machine learning core (MLC) with adaptive self-configuration (ASC), and
an analog hub / Qvar sensing channel.

The FSM and MLC with ASC deliver outstanding always-on, edge processing capabilities to the IIS2DULPX, while the analog hub / Qvar sensing channel defines a new degree of system optimization. The IIS2DULPX MIPI I3C® target interface and embedded 128-level FIFO buffer complete a set of features that make this
accelerometer a reference in terms of system integration from a standpoint of the bill of materials, processing, or power consumption.

The device has user-selectable full scales of ±2g/±4g/±8g/±16g and is capable of measuring accelerations with output data rates from 1.6 Hz to 800 Hz.

The IIS2DULPX has a dedicated internal engine to process motion and acceleration detection including free-fall, wake-up, single/double/triple-tap recognition, activity/inactivity, and 6D/4D orientation.

The device is available in a small thin plastic, land grid array (LGA) package and it is guaranteed to operate over an extended temperature range from -40°C to +105°C.
