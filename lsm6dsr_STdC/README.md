# LSM6DSR

The LSM6DSR is a system-in-package featuring a 3D digital accelerometer and a
3D digital gyroscope with an extended full-scale range for the gyroscope, up to
4000 dps, and high stability over temperature and time.

The LSM6DSR supports main OS requirements, offering real, virtual and batch
sensors with 9 kbytes with FIFO compression up to three times for dynamic data
batching.

ST’s family of MEMS sensor modules leverages the robust and mature
manufacturing processes already used for the production of micromachined
accelerometers and gyroscopes.

The LSM6DSR has a full-scale acceleration range of ±2/±4/±8/±16 g and an
angular rate range of ±125/±250/±500/±1000/±2000/±4000 dps.

The LSM6DSR embeds a broad range of advanced functions supporting Android
wearable sensors and programmable sensors (suitable for activity recognition).

The LSM6DSR is available in a plastic land grid array (LGA) package.
