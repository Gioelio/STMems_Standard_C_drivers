# A3G4250D

The A3G4250D is a low-power 3-axis angular rate
sensor able to provide unprecedented stability at
zero rate level and sensitivity over temperature
and time. It includes a sensing element and an IC
interface capable of providing the measured
angular rate to the external world through a
standard SPI digital interface. An I2C-compatible
interface is also available.

The sensing element is manufactured using a
dedicated micro-machining process developed by
STMicroelectronics to produce inertial sensors
and actuators on silicon wafers.

The IC interface is manufactured using a CMOS
process that allows a high level of integration to
design a dedicated circuit which is trimmed to
better match the sensing element characteristics.

The A3G4250D has a full scale of ±245 dps and
is capable of measuring rates with a userselectable bandwidth.

The A3G4250D is available in a plastic land grid
array (LGA) package and can operate within a
temperature range of -40 °C to +85 °C.
