# IIS3DHHC

The IIS3DHHC is an ultra-low noise, high-stability three-axis linear
accelerometer.

The IIS3DHHC has a full scale of ±2.5 g and is capable of providing the
measured accelerations to the application through an SPI 4-wire digital interface.

The sensing element is manufactured using a dedicated micromachining process
developed by STMicroelectronics to produce inertial sensors and actuators on
silicon wafers.

The IC interface is manufactured using a CMOS process that allows a high level
of integration to design a dedicated circuit which is trimmed to better match the
characteristics of the sensing element.

The IIS3DHHC is available in a high-performance (low-stress) ceramic cavity
land grid array (CC LGA) package and can operate within a temperature range of -40
°C to +85 °C.
