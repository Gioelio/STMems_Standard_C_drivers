# LSM6DSRX

The LSM6DSRX is a system-in-package featuring a high-performance 3-axis digital accelerometer and 3-axis digital gyroscope.

The LSM6DSRX delivers best-in-class motion sensing that can detect orientation and gestures in order to empower application developers and consumers with features and capabilities that are more sophisticated than simply orienting their devices to portrait and landscape mode.

This device is suitable for augmented reality and virtual reality applications as well as Optical Image Stabilization and motion-based gaming controllers as a result of its high stability over temperature and time, combined with superior sensing precision.

The LSM6DSRX fully supports OIS applications using both the gyroscope and accelerometer sensor. The device can output OIS data through a dedicated auxiliary SPI and includes a dedicated configurable signal processing path for OIS. For both the gyroscope and accelerometer, the UI signal processing path is completely independent from that of the OIS and is readable through FIFO. Moreover, self -test and full scale are available for both the UI and OIS chains.

The event-detection interrupts enable efficient and reliable motion tracking and contextual awareness, implementing hardware recognition of free-fall events, 6D orientation, click and double-click sensing, activity or inactivity, and wakeup events.

The LSM6DSRX supports main OS requirements, offering real, virtual and batch mode sensors. In addition, the LSM6DSRX can efficiently run the sensor-related features specified in Android. In particular, the LSM6DSRX has been designed to implement hardware features such as significant motion, tilt, pedometer functions, timestamping and to support the data acquisition of an external magnetometer.

The LSM6DSRX offers hardware flexibility to connect the pins with different mode connections to external sensors to expand functionalities such as adding a sensor hub.

Up to 9 kbytes of FIFO with compression and dynamic allocation of significant data (i.e. external sensors, timestamp, etc.) allows overall power saving of the system.

Like the entire portfolio of MEMS sensor modules, the LSM6DSRX leverages the robust and mature in-house manufacturing processes already used for the production of micromachined accelerometers and gyroscopes. The various sensing elements are manufactured using specialized micromachining processes, while the IC interfaces are developed using CMOS technology that allows the design of a dedicated circuit which is trimmed to better match the characteristics of the sensing element.

The LSM6DSRX is available in a small plastic land grid array (LGA) package of 2.5 x 3.0 x 0.83 mm to address ultra-compact solutions.
