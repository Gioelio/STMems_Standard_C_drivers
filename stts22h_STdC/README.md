# STTS22H

The STTS22H is a digital temperature sensor that communicates over a 2-wire
I²C/SMBus 3.0 serial interface.
Thanks to its factory calibration, the STTS22H offers high-end accuracy
performance over the entire operating
temperature range reaching as low as ±0.5 °C without requiring any further
calibration at the application level.

The sensor operating mode is user-configurable and allows selecting between
different ODRs (down to 1 Hz) or
the one-shot mode for battery saving. In one-shot mode, the sensor current
consumption falls to 1.75 µA.

The STTS22H comes in a 6-pin device that supports user-configurable slave
addresses. By connecting properly
the Addr pin (see Table 2), four different addresses can be specified, thus
allowing to have up to four STTS22H
sharing the same I²C/SMBus bus line. An interrupt pin is also available to
signal the application whenever the
user-selectable high or low threshold has been exceeded.
