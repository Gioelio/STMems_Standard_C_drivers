# LPS27HHW

The LPS27HHW is an ultra-compact
piezoresistive absolute pressure sensor which
functions as a digital output barometer. The
device comprises a sensing element and an IC
interface which communicates through I²C, MIPI
I3CSM or SPI from the sensing element to the
application.

The sensing element, which detects absolute
pressure, consists of a suspended membrane
manufactured using a dedicated process
developed by ST.

The LPS27HHW is available in a ceramic LGA
package with metal lid. It is guaranteed to operate
over a temperature range extending from -40 °C
to +85 °C. The package is holed to allow external
pressure to reach the sensing element. Gel inside
the IC protects the electrical components from
water and the metal cap is grounded electrically
for better ESD robustness.
