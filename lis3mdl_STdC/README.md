# LIS3MDL

The LIS3MDL is an ultralow-power high-performance 3-axis magnetic sensor with
user-selectable full scales of ±4/±8/±12/±16 gauss.

The self-test capability allows the user to check the functioning of the sensor
in the final application.

The device may be configured to generate interrupt signals for magnetic field
detection.

The LIS3MDL includes an I²C serial bus interface that supports standard and
fast mode (100 kHz and 400 kHz) and SPI serial standard interfaces.

The device is available in a small thin plastic, land grid array (LGA) package
and is guaranteed to operate over an extended temperature range of -40°C to +85°C.
