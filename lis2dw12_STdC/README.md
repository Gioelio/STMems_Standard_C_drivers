# LIS2DW12

The LIS2DW12 is an ultra-low-power high-performance three-axis linear
accelerometer belonging to the “femto” family which leverages on the robust and
mature manufacturing processes already used for the production of micromachined
accelerometers.

The LIS2DW12 has user-selectable full scales of ±2g/±4g/±8g/±16g and is capable
of measuring accelerations with output data rates from 1.6 Hz to 1600 Hz.

The LIS2DW12 has an integrated 32-level first-in, first-out (FIFO) buffer
allowing the user to store data in order to limit intervention by the host processor.

The embedded self-test capability allows the user to check the functioning of
the sensor in the final application.

The LIS2DW12 has a dedicated internal engine to process motion and acceleration
detection including free-fall, wakeup, highly configurable single/double-tap
recognition, activity/inactivity, stationary/motion detection,
portrait/landscape detection and 6D/4D orientation.

The LIS2DW12 is available in a small thin plastic land grid array package (LGA)
and it is guaranteed to operate over an extended temperature range from -40 °C to
+85 °C.
