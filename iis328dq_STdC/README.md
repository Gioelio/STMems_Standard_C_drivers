# IIS328DQ

The IIS328DQ is an ultra-low-power highperformance 3-axis linear accelerometer
with a digital serial interface, SPI or I2C compatible.

Recommended for industrial applications
requiring an extended temperature range and
long lifespan, the device features ultra-low-power
operational modes that allow advanced power
saving and smart sleep-to-wakeup functions. The
IIS328DQ has dynamic user-selectable full-scales
of ±2g/±4g/±8g and is capable of measuring
accelerations with output data rates from 0.5 Hz
to 1 kHz. The self-test capability allows the user to
check the functioning of the sensor in the final
application. The device may be configured to
generate an interrupt signal through inertial
wakeup events, or by the position of the device
itself. Interrupt generators are programmable by
the end user on-the-fly. Available in a small, quad,
flat pack no-lead package (QFPN) with a 4x4 mm
footprint, the IIS328DQ corresponds to the trend
towards application miniaturization, and is
guaranteed to operate over a temperature range
from -40 °C to +105 °C.
