# LSM6DSO32

The LSM6DSO32 is a system-in-package featuring a
3D digital accelerometer and 3D digital gyroscope
boosting power performance to 0.55 mA in highperformance mode and enabling
always-on low-power features for an optimal motion experience for the
consumer.

The LSM6DSO32 supports main OS requirements,
offering real, virtual and batch sensors with 9 kbytes for
dynamic data batching. ST’s family of MEMS sensor
modules leverages the robust and mature
manufacturing processes already used for the
production of micromachined accelerometers and
gyroscopes. The various sensing elements are
manufactured using specialized micromachining
processes, while the IC interfaces are developed using
CMOS technology that allows the design of a dedicated
circuit which is trimmed to better match the
characteristics of the sensing element.

The LSM6DSO32 has a full-scale acceleration range of
±4/±8/±16±32 g and an angular rate range of
±125/±250/±500/±1000/±2000 dps.
High robustness to mechanical shock makes the
LSM6DSO32 the preferred choice of system designers
for the creation and manufacturing of reliable products.

The LSM6DSO32 is available in a plastic land grid
array (LGA) package.
