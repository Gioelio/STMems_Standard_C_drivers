# IIS2DLPC

The IIS2DLPC is an ultra-low-power high-performance
three-axis linear accelerometer with digital I²C/SPI
output interface which leverages on the robust and
mature manufacturing processes already used for the
production of micromachined accelerometers.

The IIS2DLPC has user-selectable full scales of
±2g/±4g/±8g/±16g and is capable of measuring
accelerations with output data rates from 1.6 Hz to
1600 Hz.

The IIS2DLPC has one high-performance mode and 4
low-power modes which can be changed on the fly,
providing outstanding versatility and adaptability to the
requirements of the application.
The IIS2DLPC has an integrated 32-level first-in, first-out
(FIFO) buffer allowing the user to store data in order to
limit intervention by the host processor.

The embedded self-test capability allows the user to
check the functioning of the sensor in the final
application.

The IIS2DLPC has a dedicated internal engine to
process motion and acceleration detection including
free-fall, wakeup, highly configurable single/double-tap
recognition, activity/inactivity, stationary/motion
detection, portrait/landscape detection and 6D/4D
orientation.

The IIS2DLPC is available in a small thin plastic land
grid array package (LGA) and it is guaranteed to operate
over an extended temperature range from -40 °C to
+85 °C.
