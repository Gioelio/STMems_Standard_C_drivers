# AIS3624DQ

The AIS3624DQ is an ultra-low-power highperformance three-axis accelerometer
with a
digital serial interface SPI standard output, an I2C
compatible interface is also available.

The device features ultra-low-power operational
modes that allow advanced power saving and
smart sleep-to-wake functions.

The AIS3624DQ has dynamically user selectable
full scales of ±6g/±12g/±24g and it is capable of
measuring accelerations with output data rates
from 0.5 Hz to 1 kHz.

The self-test capability allows the user to check
the functioning of the sensor in the final
application.

The device may be configured to generate an
interrupt signal by inertial wakeup/free-fall events
as well as by the position of the device itself.
Thresholds and timing of interrupt generators are
programmable by the end user on the fly.

The AIS3624DQ is available in small, quad flat
no-lead package (QFN) with the reduced 4x4 mm
footprint required by many applications and it is
guaranteed to operate over an extended
temperature range from -40 °C to +105 °C.

This product may be used in a variety of
automotive non-safety applications such as:
- Motion-activated functions
- Telematic boxes
- Impact recognition and logging systems
- Vibration monitoring and compensation
