# HTS221

HTS221 is in the process of being terminated and
is not recommended for new design. The
candidate replacement is SHT40-AD1B from
Sensirion. A deep-dive transition guide, technical
note TN1426, is available on www.st.com,
providing a high-level reference to guide the user
in replacing STMicroelectronics HTS221 sensor
with the SHT4x sensor family from Sensirion as a
high-quality alternative.

The HTS221 is an ultracompact sensor for
relative humidity and temperature. It includes a
sensing element and a mixed signal ASIC to
provide the measurement information through
digital serial interfaces.

The sensing element consists of a polymer
dielectric planar capacitor structure capable of
detecting relative humidity variations and is
manufactured using a dedicated ST process.

The HTS221 is available in a small top-holed cap
land grid array (HLGA) package guaranteed to
operate over a temperature range from -40 °C to
+120 °C.
