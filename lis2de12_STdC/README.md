# LIS2DE12

The LIS2DE12 is an ultra-low-power highperformance three-axis linear
accelerometer
belonging to the “femto” family with digital I2C/SPI
serial interface standard output.

The LIS2DE12 has user-selectable full scales of
2g/±4g/8g/16g and is capable of measuring
accelerations with output data rates from 1 Hz to
5.3 kHz.

The self-test capability allows the user to check
the functionality of the sensor in the final
application.

The device may be configured to generate
interrupt signals by detecting two independent
inertial wake-up/free-fall events as well as by the
position of the device itself.

The LIS2DE12 is available in a small thin plastic
land grid array package (LGA) and is guaranteed
to operate over an extended temperature range
from -40 °C to +85 °C.
