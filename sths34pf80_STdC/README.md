# STHS34PF80

The STHS34PF80 is an uncooled, factory-calibrated, infrared motion and presence
detection sensor with
operating wavelength between 5 µm and 20 µm.

The STHS34PF80 sensor has been designed to measure the amount of IR radiation
emitted from an object within
its field of view. The information is digitally processed by the ASIC, which
can be programmed to monitor motion,
presence, or an overtemperature condition.

Thanks to its exceptional sensitivity, the STHS34PF80 can detect the presence
of a human being at a distance up
to 4 meters without the need of an optical lens.

The STHS34PF80 is housed in a small 3.2 x 4.2 x 1.455 (max) mm 10-lead LGA
package.
