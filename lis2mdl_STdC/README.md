# LIS2MDL

The LIS2MDL is an ultra-low-power, highperformance 3-axis digital magnetic
sensor.

The LIS2MDL has a magnetic field dynamic
range of ±50 gauss.

The LIS2MDL includes an I2C serial bus interface
that supports standard, fast mode, fast mode
plus, and high-speed (100 kHz, 400 kHz,
1 MHz, and 3.4 MHz) and an SPI serial standard
interface.

The device can be configured to generate an
interrupt signal for magnetic field detection.

The LIS2MDL is available in a plastic land grid
array package (LGA) and is guaranteed to
operate over an extended temperature range
from -40 °C to +85 °C.
