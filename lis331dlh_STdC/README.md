# LIS331DLH

The LIS331DLH is an ultra low-power high
performance three axes linear accelerometer
belonging to the “nano” family, with digital I2C/SPI
serial interface standard output.

The device features ultra low-power operational
modes that allow advanced power saving and
smart sleep to wake-up functions.

The LIS331DLH has dynamically user selectable
full scales of ±2g/±4g/±8g and it is capable of
measuring accelerations with output data rates
from 0.5 Hz to 1 kHz.

The self-test capability allows the user to check
the functioning of the sensor in the final
application.

The device may be configured to generate
interrupt signal by inertial wake-up/free-fall events
as well as by the position of the device itself.
Thresholds and timing of interrupt generators are
programmable by the end user on the fly.

The LIS331DLH is available in small thin plastic
land grid array package (LGA) and it is
guaranteed to operate over an extended
temperature range from -40 °C to +85 °C.
